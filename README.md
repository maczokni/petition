### petition visualiser

##### About
This Shiny application was designed to explore the distribution of signatures for a problematic petition put to the UK government . 
It looks at the number of signatures from each constituency, as well as the affiliation of the local MP. 
It can also be used to look at the top non-UK countries signing the petition, and to look at any relationship betweeen number of signatures and political affiliation.
